# Asciiart Message

[Figlet]() is a terminal application for quickly creating asciinema text.

Here is how we would greet our users with some ascii-ized letters:

```bash

t$ singularity shell asciiart.sif 
Singularity: Invoking an interactive shell within container...

                                      _ 
__   ____ _ _ __   ___  ___ ___  __ _| |
\ \ / / _` | '_ \ / _ \/ __/ __|/ _` | |
 \ V / (_| | | | |  __/\__ \__ \ (_| |_|
  \_/ \__,_|_| |_|\___||___/___/\__,_(_)
                                        
fwoop! ...you are in a container...

```

See the [Singularity](Singularity) recipe to see how to install figlet, and
then use it to print to the terminal.
